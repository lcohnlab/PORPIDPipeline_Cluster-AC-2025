Download alignments from the LANL website to use as the panel files.
https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/NEWALIGN/align.html

Alignment type: Compendium
Organism: HIV-1/SIVcpz
Regions: User-defined range (see below)
Subtype: M group with CRFs
DNA/Protein: DNA
Year: 2019
Format:Fasta

Set user defined range of HXB2 coordinates to encompass your amplicon plus ~100bp on either side
Examples:
GP: 600-3600
POL: 1600-5600
REN: 5800-9200
REN: 5000-9200
WG: 600-9300

1) Align your cDNA and 2nd rd fwd primers to the compendium alignment

2) Trim the alignment to remove the primer sequences and everything up or downstream
	-The alignment should now be the exact size of your final sequences
	-It is critical the alignment matches your final sequence or sequences will be trimmed to match the alignment

3) Strip all columns from the alignment that have gaps in >90% of sequences. 
	-In Geneious: Tools -> Mask Alignment -> "Save a copy with sites stripped", "Sites containing "Gaps (%)" 90%" -> OK

4) Give stripped alignment new unique name (preferably listing 2nd rd Primers) and upload to the
panel directory in PORPIDpipeline
